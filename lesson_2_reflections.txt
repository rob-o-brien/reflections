What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden folder called.git is created. You need to do it to store commits

*******************

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a halfway house between the working directory and the repository. It allows you to select only
the files in the working directory you want added to the repository rather than all of them. 

********************

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area allows you to pick and choose which files to add to it thus each commit you do can be selective.

*********************

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If you wanted to experiment with new features, or create a different version of the program. 
Branches help by using a human readable name and branches can be merged later on if need be. 

**********************

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams help you easily see the parent history of each commit on a branch as well as the relationship
between branches. 

*********************

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The result is you are left with one master branch with a history of all the commits of both branches included.
We represent it like this to show that when the two branches are combined there will still be a master branch.
