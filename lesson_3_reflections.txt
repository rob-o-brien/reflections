When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share it with others, use a different PC or store it remotely for safekeeping. 

************************

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In case someone else has made changes to the same branch you are currently checking out.
