When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share it with others, use a different PC or store it remotely for safekeeping. 

************************

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In case someone else has made changes to the same branch you are currently checking out.

*************************

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A branch is part of a repository whereas clones and forks are copies of a repository.

You use a branch to create a seperate version of a local repository, you use clone to create a copy of an existing 
repository and you use fork to clone someone elses repository.

*************************

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows you to do a diff on the local and the locally stored remote before merging and committing
