When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share it with others, use a different PC or store it remotely for safekeeping. 

************************

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In case someone else has made changes to the same branch you are currently checking out.

*************************

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A branch is part of a repository whereas clones and forks are copies of a repository.

You use a branch to create a seperate version of a local repository, you use clone to create a copy of an existing 
repository and you use fork to clone someone elses repository.

*************************

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows you to do a diff on the local and the locally stored remote before merging and committing

***************************

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would share files on Dropbox. If we were sure no edits would cause a conflict and it wasn't too important
to review the history of changes it would be easier but as soon as we both started editing the same portions
of files then it would become much harder without Github. 

***********************

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When you are collaborating you do not want your changes to effect the master branch until it has been agreed upon by others. You initiate
a pull request to do so. 

The benefit of commiting directly to master is that it's more straightforward.
